# PFTool

## Introduction
 `PFTool` is a computational program and also a database for [Picard-Fuchs equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Fuchs_equation). 
 We defined our data structure(class `PFO`) for a PF operator. 
 In our database, there is a local version of the famous [AESZ database](https://cydb.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/), 
 which contains only [Calabi-Yau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold) operators.
