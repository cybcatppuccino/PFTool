Genus 0 Congruence Subgroups.m == For a genus 0 congruence subgroup Gamma (up to conjugation in PGL_2(Z)) we compute its hauptmodul h, and 
                                  a rational function pi_(t) in K_N(t) such that pi(h)=j. Here N is the level of Gamma, K_N is the N-th cyclotomic field
                                  and j is the modular j-invariant function.

 16G.m ==For the genus 0 congruence subgroup with Cummins Pauli label 16G0, when we compute a pair (P^1,\pi) with properties as explained in 
section 8.1 we notice that there are some nontrivial cocycles from Gal(K/Q) -> A_{G_1}. For each such cocycle we compute the set of cocycles
{Gamma_j'} as explained in paragraph following lemma 8.5 at level 15. For each Gamma_j' we compute the twist corresponding to it along with j-map. 

5H.m ==For the genus 0 congruence subgroup with Cummins Pauli label 5H0, when we compute a pair (P^1,\pi) with properties as explained in 
section 8.1 we notice that there are some nontrivial cocycles from Gal(K/Q) -> A_{G_1}. For each such cocycle we compute the set of cocycles
{Gamma_j'} as explained in paragraph following lemma 8.5 at level 15. For each Gamma_j' we compute the twist corresponding to it along with j-map. 

8N.m== For the genus 0 congruence subgroup with Cummins Pauli label 8N0, when we compute a pair (P^1,\pi) with properties as explained in 
section 8.1 we notice that there are some nontrivial cocycles from Gal(K/Q) -> A_{G_1}. For each such cocycle we compute the set of cocycles
{Gamma_j'} as explained in paragraph following lemma 8.5 at level 15. For each Gamma_j' we compute the twist corresponding to it along with j-map.
